## 6️⃣ Conclusion

The ClipMe application has a solid foundation with good mobile responsiveness and accessibility compliance, but suffers from several critical functionality gaps that prevent it from being production-ready. The core real-time sharing features are either missing or broken, which significantly impacts the user experience.

**Priority Focus Areas:**

1. Backend API stability and clipboard data retrieval
2. Real-time synchronization and user presence features
3. File upload system implementation
4. Room security and password protection features

Once these critical issues are resolved, the application will be well-positioned to provide the intended real-time clipboard sharing experience across devices.
